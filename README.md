## Description
Challenge week 6. Try not to judge me on this one I had been working on the project and totally forgot I had to do this. I follow this guide:

https://dev.to/shantanu_jana/how-to-make-a-weather-app-using-javascript-4lke

I changed up some of the functions and made it look more appealing. It was actually a pretty good guide and I'm glad I found it cuz I think I would been pretty clueless without it. It also helped me a lot on functions since I had to convert Kelvin to Farenheit and KMH to MPH

I know it's missing some functionality I just wanted to submit something
